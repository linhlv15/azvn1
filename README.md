# Pomodoro Timer
After reading the detailed instructions in the README files, I followed and completed the basic instructions to install Fullter and Vscode. Next, I carefully read the TODOs section and the explanations about Pomodoro/Short Break/Long Break. Below is what I did in the test and the TODOs requirements:
- Provides a function that allows users to start and reset the timer
- Can switch between Pomodoro, Short Break and Long Break modes.
- The loop function can be turned off if the user only wants to perform one of the three modes.
- Can track completed Pomodoro cycles.
- There is a notification bell when each mode has finished running.
- Can choose the type of notification sound and turn off the notification sound if the user does not want it.

# Things learned through the project process
After taking this test, I understood more things and encountered new things that I had never encountered before. Learned how a Pomodoro Timer works. I know how to use Vscode to practice with flutter framework and dart programming language to do tests.
